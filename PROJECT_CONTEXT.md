# PlantCam Project Context

## Project Overview

PlantCam is a web application designed to monitor and control a plant care system using a Raspberry Pi. The application provides remote access to plant monitoring and watering capabilities through a secure cloudflared tunnel connected to a Cloudflare domain.

## Core Features

### Live Streaming

- Real-time video feed of plants
- Accessible through web interface
- Camera integration with Raspberry Pi

### Plant Control System

- Remote watering control panel
- Manual watering trigger functionality
- Potential for automated watering schedules

### Infrastructure

- Hosted on Raspberry Pi
- Secured via cloudflared tunnel
- Connected to Cloudflare domain for easy access

### Future Considerations

- Additional sensor integration possibilities:
  - Soil moisture sensors
  - Temperature sensors
  - Humidity sensors
  - Light level sensors
  - pH sensors

## Technical Requirements

- Web application framework for UI
- Video streaming capabilities
- GPIO control for watering system
- Secure tunnel configuration
- Sensor data collection and display
- Real-time monitoring and control interface

## Notes

- Created: July 13, 2025
- Primary goal: Remote plant monitoring and care
- Extensible design to allow for future sensor additions
