# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves redesigning the authentication pages (login and signup) to match the visual style and user experience of the main dashboard. The current authentication pages have a basic design that doesn't align with the sophisticated, nature-themed aesthetic of the dashboard with its animated background, glass morphism effects, and cohesive visual language.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user visiting the login page, I want the page to have the same visual appeal and branding as the dashboard, so that I experience a consistent and professional interface throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the login page THEN the system SHALL display the same animated nature background as the dashboard
2. WHEN the login form is displayed THEN the system SHALL use glass morphism styling consistent with dashboard cards
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL include the same entrance animations used on the dashboard
4. WHEN the user interacts with form elements THEN the system SHALL provide the same micro-interactions and hover effects as dashboard components
5. WHEN the page is viewed on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design consistency with the dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user visiting the signup page, I want the page to have the same visual appeal and branding as the dashboard, so that I experience a consistent and professional interface throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the signup page THEN the system SHALL display the same animated nature background as the dashboard
2. WHEN the signup form is displayed THEN the system SHALL use glass morphism styling consistent with dashboard cards
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL include the same entrance animations used on the dashboard
4. WHEN the user interacts with form elements THEN the system SHALL provide the same micro-interactions and hover effects as dashboard components
5. WHEN the page is viewed on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design consistency with the dashboard

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication forms to maintain their current functionality while having an improved visual design, so that I can still authenticate successfully with a better user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits the login form THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing authentication logic and error handling
2. WHEN a user submits the signup form THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing registration logic and validation
3. WHEN form validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL display error messages using the same styling as dashboard notifications
4. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing redirect behavior
5. WHEN loading states are active THEN the system SHALL use consistent loading indicators with the dashboard design

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user on mobile devices, I want the authentication pages to be as responsive and touch-friendly as the dashboard, so that I can easily authenticate on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the authentication pages are viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL use the same responsive breakpoints as the dashboard
2. WHEN touch interactions occur on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate touch targets and feedback
3. WHEN the virtual keyboard appears THEN the system SHALL handle viewport adjustments gracefully
4. WHEN the pages are viewed in landscape orientation THEN the system SHALL maintain usability and visual appeal
5. WHEN reduced motion preferences are set THEN the system SHALL respect accessibility preferences like the dashboard

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication pages to include the same branding elements as the dashboard, so that I feel confident I'm on the correct application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the authentication pages load THEN the system SHALL display the PlantCam branding with the same styling as the dashboard
2. WHEN the pages are displayed THEN the system SHALL use the same color scheme and typography as the dashboard
3. WHEN interactive elements are present THEN the system SHALL use the same button styles and form input designs as the dashboard
4. WHEN status indicators are shown THEN the system SHALL use consistent iconography and visual language
5. WHEN navigation links are present THEN the system SHALL maintain the same link styling and hover effects as the dashboard

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user on the authentication pages, I want to have access to the same header layout and user menu as the dashboard, so that I have consistent navigation and branding throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the authentication pages load THEN the system SHALL display the same header layout structure as the dashboard
2. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL show appropriate header content without user-specific menu items
3. WHEN the header is displayed THEN the system SHALL use the same PlantCam title styling and positioning as the dashboard
4. WHEN the header is viewed on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain the same responsive behavior as the dashboard header
5. WHEN the header elements are interacted with THEN the system SHALL provide the same visual feedback and animations as the dashboard
